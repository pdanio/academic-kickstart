The increased availability and heterogeneity of health data has prompted the recent increase in data sharing initiatives between foundations, research institutions and the public itself. Such initiatives have led to major developments - especially with the use of AI models - in medical research. On the other hand, the increased linkage of disparate data increasingly puts involved individuals who own the data at risk of re-identification through linkage attacks. As such, data protection legislations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Swiss Health Research Act (HRA) play an important role in defining the privacy requirements to share personal health data, as well as play a pivotal role in drafting internal data policies and data sharing agreements. Our current analysis assesses the current landscape of health data sharing initiatives, how they are defined in policies and how they comply to regulations.
