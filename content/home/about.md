We focus on research questions at the intersection of public law, technology, and medicine. We are driven by the goal to conduct research that serves society and countries. 

Within our research activities, we focus on questions of how to regulate and improve access to emerging technologies in general (e.g., artificial intelligence) and with a special focus on medicine (e.g., cancer drugs, medical products). We also focus on questions of how technology impacts the law, and how technology can serve the public while respecting individualsâ€™ fundamental rights.
Methodologically, our group applies traditional legal methods in public law as well as empirical methods to develop policy and regulatory implications in the areas of public law, technology, and medicine (regulatory sciences). 

We also collaborate with Scientists from other Faculties and Universities. 
Our studies have been published in national and international legal, medical, and health policy journals (e.g., Lancet Oncology, JAMA, ZSR, Jusletter) as well as presented in national and international conferences. Our research projects have been supported, for example, by the Swiss National Foundation (SNF), Swiss Cancer Foundation (Krebsforschung Schweiz), Botnar Foundation, or Digital Society Initiative (DSI).

In our areas of expertise we advise governmental authorities, and non-profit national and international organizations.
