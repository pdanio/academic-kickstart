Our recently published [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147020452030139X?via%3Dihub) on the association between the clinical benefit of recently approved cancer drugs and their average monthly treatment costs at launch was mentioned on [SwissInfo](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/university-of-zurich_swiss-study-sees-no-link-between-cancer-drug-prices-and-patient-benefits/45728788). As prices of precision oncology treatments is increasing, our study highlights the importance of forming coalitions between countries in order to improve alignment of pricing and benefit.
