Our recently published [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2019.16842) on the regulatory lifecyle of FDA-approved AI/ML-based medical devices was mentioned on [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-is-rushing-into-patient-care-and-could-raise-risks/?utm_medium=social&utm_content=organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=SciAm_&sf226835386=1). Our study emphasizes how recent regulatory approvals of AI/ML devices did not require that clinical testing be undertaken, which puts their impact on patients in question.
