The results from our recently published [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3434) on the association between FDA and EMA expedited approval programs and therapeutic value of new medicines was mentioned in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/health/covid-remdesivir-gilead.html). Our results highlight the importance of recognizing that regulatory approval does not guarantee high drug benefits, a topic which is relevant as current COVID-19 vaccines are in the race to receive regulatory approval and enter markets.
