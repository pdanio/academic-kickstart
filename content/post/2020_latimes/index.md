Our recently published [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2019.16842) on the regulatory lifecyle of FDA-approved AI/ML-based medical devices was mentioned on [the Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-01-03/artificial-intelligence-healthcare). Our study emphasizes how recent regulatory approvals of AI/ML devices did not require that clinical testing be undertaken, which puts their impact on patients in question.
