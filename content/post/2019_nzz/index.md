Our recently published [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851019303008?via%3Dihub) on the divergence of time of approval of cancer drugs and their pricing decision was  mentioned on [NZZ am Sonntag](https://nzzas.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/krebsmedikamente-werden-von-der-krankenkasse-oft-spaet-verguetet-ld.1531081#register). In recent years, the time period between the approval of cancer drugs and inclusion on the swiss Spezialit√§tenliste has increased, which delays accessibility of cancer drugs to patients. As such, it is recommended that time limits are set on price negotations for cancer drugs with high clinical benefits to ensure their timely accessibility to patients.
