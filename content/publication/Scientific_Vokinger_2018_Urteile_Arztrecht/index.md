abstract: "Within the framework of an empirical and casuistic analysis of Federal Court decisions in medical law between 2000 and 2017, the goal was to describe tendencies and patterns of Federal Court decisions in medical law. Among other things, our results show that specialists in internal medicine, psychiatry, gynecology, obstetrics and surgery are more frequently involved in federal court proceedings. By contrast, pathologists, forensic specialists or (diagnostic) radiologists are rarely represented. This may be explained by the fact that the first group consists of more physicians than the other specialties. Furthermore, in the first group, either stronger action may be taken against the will of the patient (e.g. in the context of compulsory medication in psychiatry) or a possible breach of the duty of care is more obvious for the patient or his relatives or at least recognizable even without medical knowledge."
