	abstract = {Pharmacoepidemiologists in their daily work encounter many different issues that have legal implications. How practitioners interface with systems of rules set by tort law and contract law principles can be vital to their work. Product liability cases, a variant of tort law, allege failure to warn about adverse events linked to pharmaceutical products. Such cases may arise out of pharmacoepidemiologic studies linking drugs to problematic safety outcomes and often involve practitioners in this field as expert witnesses. These cases are usually based on the principle of strict liability; that is, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant manufacturer had knowledge of a particular adverse event and did not appropriately warn about the risk, thus causing the damages. However, differences between scientific and legal standards for causation can complicate these cases. In the US, manufacturers have argued that FDA approval of the drug label preempts most failure-to-warn product liability claims, but a recent Supreme Court case (Wyeth v. Levine) ruled that preemption does not apply. European courts have similar strict liability and other rules, but lower damage compensation and other differences in the judicial system can lead to disparate litigation rates. Pharmacoepidemiologists must also understand basic principles of contract law when performing research for a sponsor, whether it be government or industry. The contract represents the full outline of the agreement between the parties and is evidence of the partiesâ€™ intentions if there is a disagreement which ends up in court. Sponsored research also presents a risk of conflict of interest. Therefore, investigators should carefully consider contract language limiting their access to data or their ability to publish their results. Finally, pharmacoepidemiologists interface with intellectual property law when they attempt to secure ownership rights over their discoveries through the use of patents. In the US, inventors must apply to the US Patent and Trademark Office to earn a patent; by contrast, in Europe, patent protection can be sought via national patents, European patents, or unitary patents. While patents may secure monopoly ownership of research methods, they may also enhance barriers to cooperation and raise the costs of basic research.},
