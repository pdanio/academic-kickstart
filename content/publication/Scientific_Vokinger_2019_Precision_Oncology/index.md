abstract: "Social health insurance is mandatory in Switzerland and covers the costs of basic medical care. In general, with regard to medicines, the costs are only reimbursed if the drug is (1) approved by Swissmedic and (2) listed on the so-called Spezialitaetenliste (SL) by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). However, the SL does not include all drugs. For non-SL drugs, cost coverage is only granted under exceptional circumstances. Absence of cost coverage by social health insurance is especially problematic for patients who need access to cancer drugs, since they are often costly. Even if such cancer drugs are approved by Swissmedic, patients may still lack access to them. Therefore, access to medicines includes two aspects: (1) the availability of a drug on the market (i.e., approval of a drug) and (2) inclusion on the SL (i.e., cost coverage by social health insurance). In this study, we aim to compare the current approval regulations for oncologic precision medicines in the USA, Europe, and Switzerland; to investigate cost coverage for these drugs in Switzerland; and to develop health policy implications about how access to these drugs could be improved in Switzerland."
