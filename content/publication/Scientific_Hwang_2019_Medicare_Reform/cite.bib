	abstract = {Importance: The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has proposed to reform drug pricing in Medicare Part B, which primarily covers physician-administered drugs and biologic agents. One HHS proposal would shift coverage of certain drugs from Medicare Part B to Part D, which is administered by private prescription drug plans.
Objective: To estimate the association of changes of a shift in Medicare Part B to Part D with total drug spending and patient cost-sharing.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective drug cohort study of the 75 brand-name drugs associated with the highest Part B expenditures among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2016.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated total Medicare spending in Part B and Part D; annual out-of-pocket costs in Part B and under the standard 2018 Part D benefit; and proportion of drugs in Part D's protected drug classes (immunosuppressants for prophylaxis of organ transplant rejection, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and antineoplastics).
Results: At 2018 prices, total Medicare Part B spending for the 75 brand-name drugs with the highest Part B expenditures was estimated to be \$21.6 billion annually. Under the proposed policy, total Part D drug spending for these drugs was estimated to range between \$17.6 billion and \$20.1 billion after rebates, corresponding to a 6.9\% to 18.3\% decrease in drug spending in Part D compared with Part B. Of the 75 drugs studied, 33 (44.0\%) drugs, accounting for \$9.5 billion (43.9\%) in Part B spending, were in protected Part D classes where plans must cover essentially all drugs. For 67 drugs with available information, the prices for 65 (97.0\%) were a median of 45.8\% to 59.7\% lower in comparator high-income countries than Part B drug prices. Median patient cost-sharing in Part B for all 75 brand-name drugs was \$4683 (interquartile range [IQR], \$1069-\$9282) per year. Shifting Part B drugs to the 2018 standard Part D benefit was projected to decrease out-of-pocket costs by a median of \$860 (IQR, -\$3884 to \$496) among Medicare beneficiaries without Medicaid or Part B supplemental insurance (Medigap). For beneficiaries who would qualify for the low-income subsidy program in Part D, cost-sharing would be lower in Part D than in Part B for all drugs. For beneficiaries with Medigap insurance, estimated Part D out-of-pocket costs exceeded average Medigap premium costs by a median of \$1460 for those with Part D coverage and by a median of \$1952 for those without Part D coverage.
Conclusions and Relevance: Although the HHS proposal to shift certain drugs from Medicare Part B to Part D may reduce total drug spending, it may increase out-of-pocket costs for some Medicare beneficiaries, including those with Medicare supplement insurance. The Department of Health and Human Services should ensure that the proposed reforms benefit both patients and payers.},
