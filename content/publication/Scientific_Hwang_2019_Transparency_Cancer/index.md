abstract: "Transparency in the development of new medicines has the potential to improve the efficiency and quality of clinical research by allowing investigators and companies to learn from successes and failures of similar products. It also reflects the ethical responsibility of regulators and sponsors to inform patients and involve them in the translation of research into clinical care. Recent regulatory changes issued in the United States, Europe, and Canada have substantially expanded transparency into the drug development enterprise. Herein, we examine differences in these new transparency policies and assess how these policies could benefit cancer research and drug development."
