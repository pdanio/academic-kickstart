	abstract = {Background
Approved drugs must be included on the so-called “special list” (SL) by the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) to be reimbursed by the social health insurance in Switzerland. The FOPH decides whether a drug may be included on SL and if so, negotiates the maximum price with the manufacturer. Time period between approval and inclusion on SL is important to evaluate accessibility of patients to drugs.
Methods
We identified all approved cancer drugs for first indication between 2009–2018 in Switzerland and determined whether they have been included on SL, and if so, how many days passed between approval and reimbursement, i.e., inclusion on SL. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed by using R.
Results
70 cancer drugs have been approved between 2009 and 2018. Among this sample, 56 (80 \%) are on SL. Average time from drug approval to inclusion date on SL increased from 234 days in 2009 to 463 days in 2018, with an average time of 352 days over the full analysis period.
Conclusion
Time period between approval and inclusion on SL has prolonged over the past years. This impedes patients’ access to cancer drugs. Prioritizing HTA and price negotiation of cancer drugs with high clinical benefit or implement a regulation that sets a maximum time period for HTA and price negotiation are possible policy implications.},
