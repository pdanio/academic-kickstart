abstract: "There has been an alarming increase in opioid addiction in the last twenty years in the US. The number of people who died from an opioid-related overdose has quadrupled since 1999. Two important drivers of the opioid epidemic have been the under-treatment of opioid use disorders and the aggressive marketing strategies of pharmaceutical companies. One potential source of novel policy approaches to address these two contributing factors can be found among the countries of Western Europe, where fewer people die of opioid abuse and where prescription rates for opioids are currently 2.5 to 4 times lower than in the US."
